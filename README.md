# AUTOMATING MYSQL DATABASE PROVISIONING WITH TERRAFORM

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Organizations often face challenges in efficiently provisioning MySQL databases within their infrastructure. Manual setups are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack scalability. There is a need for an automated solution that ensures consistency, reliability, and rapid deployment of MySQL databases.

## USE-CASE SCENARIO

Consider a scenario where an organization is expanding its online services and needs to deploy multiple MySQL databases to support growing data requirements. Manual setup would be impractical due to the risk of errors and time constraints. An automated solution using Terraform can provide a streamlined and repeatable process for provisioning MySQL databases across different environments.

## TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

1. **Define Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Create Terraform scripts to define the desired state of the MySQL infrastructure, specifying details like database instances, users, and access controls.

2. **Terraform Initialization:** Initialize the Terraform configuration to set up the working directory and required plugins.

3. **Terraform Plan:** Review the execution plan generated by Terraform to understand the changes it will make to the infrastructure.

4. **Terraform Apply:** Apply the defined infrastructure changes to provision MySQL databases automatically.

5. **Verify and Monitor:** Implement validation steps to ensure the successful deployment of databases and set up monitoring for ongoing management.

## SOLUTION:

### PRE-REQUIREMENTS:

- **Cloud:** AWS
  
- **IAC:** Terraform
- **Database:** AWS MySQL RDS Database
- **User:** IAM User

---

## STEP 1 â€“ CREATING AN IAM USER & ACCESS-KEY AND SECRET-KEY ACCESS

1. Create an **IAM User** with the following policies:
   - **AmazonEC2FullAccess**
   - **AmazonRDSFullAccess**

2. Generate an **access key and secret key** for the IAM User created in step 1. This key pair will be used for authentication when interacting with AWS services.
